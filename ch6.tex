\chapter{"Run" Functions in C++ and R}
One of the great things about R is all the built-in functions (sum, sd, var, etc.) and the extensive list of packages if you are looking for a function or feature that is not included in base R. The TTR and zoo packages include several functions that run over a certain window such as runSD, runMin, runMax, runMean. For example, runMean calculates a simple moving average over n periods.

\section{Running Min and Max}
The run\_min and run\_max are useful for computing donchian channels for technical analysis.

\section{Running Mean}
