\chapter{Basic Arithmetic Operations on Vectors in C++ and R}
The first thing to notice is that with functions in C++, the return type and argument type have to be declared in the function. Also note functions can have the same name with different arguments. In R, if x and y are vectors we can add the vectors with x + y. We can't do this in C++, at least not without overloading the + operator. Rcpp sugar makes this possible with a little bit of what seems like "magic". Rcpp sugar will be covered later.
